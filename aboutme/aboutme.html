    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> I was born and raised in Zimbabwe and i come from a family of 5. I have two brothers and a half sister. 
        I served my mission in freetown, Sierra Leone from January 2019 to 2021. I love socialising with people
        and playing sports. I used to play cricket in high school and also did rack. I generally love learning 
        new things and am looking forward to learning from everyone in my class.
