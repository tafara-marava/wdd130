      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Tafara Marava, and I am a full stack developer who also is the Co-owner of Stomgenix Enterprises, a chemical company based in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. I wish to create a website for this enterprise, where consumers have easy access to the various products that we sell such as dishwashing liquid, hand sanitizers and floor polishes. To make this site unique, I will add a promotion where those who visit the site for the first time and those who refer others to make a purchase will receive a free 20oz container of hand sanitizer and a box of face masks in efforts to reduce the spread of covid-19 . This will increase traffic on the website, and you will be swarmed by new clients each day thus potentially doubling your yearly sales and profits. Would you be willing to set aside a time so that we can meet and further discuss how we can get the site up and running? 
        
        FAQs/Feedback
        1.Will there be a way to process payments through the website? If so, what modes of payments will be accepted on the site?
        2.What are your geographical boundaries for shipping the products? Will you be shipping them both locally and internationally?

        We are a chemical company targeted towards improving your hygiene in your homes, churches, schools and other corporate buildings. Our site seeks to help consumers find the products they need in an easier way.

        About Us
        Stormgenix is a company based in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Our company started operating in 2020, around the same time that the Covid-19 pandemic started affecting the world. We became an officially registered company in December, 2021. Our desire to start this company was born from our love for the community and our desire to help lessen the life changing impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. We intended to do so by offering quality cleaning detergents such as dishwashing liquid, pine gels, toilet dip, floor polish and hand sanitizers. 

        Within the next few years, we hope to achieve our dream of being a nationwide company whose services and products are available to use in organisations such as schools, clinics, hospitals, restaurants, butcheries and even in people’s homes. We wish to have a company that takes the form of a one-stop-shop when it comes to buying all the cleaning materials that one would ever need. We will also strive to make sure that the products we distribute to our customers will be environmentally friendly, and will provide guidelines on how to use them such that they do not cause side effects such as allergies and skin irritations

        Feedback
        In an effort to improve user experience on our websites, we will also periodically conduct surveys to find out from our customers how their experience has been with our website. We will begin from their experiences in shipping time to payment methods, the pricing of our products, whether or not they are environmentally friendly and also rate our products on the extent to which they cause side effects and allergic reactions. The feedback that we receive from our customers will be extremely valuable to us, so to compensate them for taking their time to complete our surveys, a few people will be awarded discount coupons for some of the products that we will have on offer.

        Other Services
        Stormgenix enterprise will also be offering cleaning services to hospitals, clinics, schools and other professional buildings. The cleaning services will be customised according to our clients’ needs.
